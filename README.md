# pyflagoras
A command line interface tool to generate pride flags from images.

## Setup 
You can install this package from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)!
```python
pip install pyflagoras
```

## Adding other flags 
The current pride flags are sourced from @/JoeHart's [Pride Flag API](https://github.com/JoeHart/pride-flag-api). To add a new flag, open a pull request with the file name `<flag_name>_<year_of_release>.json`. Make sure this `.json` file follows the format of the other flags under `/src/pyflagoras/flags`

## Notes
Mainly inspired by [Twitter](https://x.com/search?q=color%20pick%20flag&src=typed_query)/[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/colourpickingpride)/other fandom spaces colour picking pride flags from pictures of their favourite characters.

See also the [prideflagbot](https://twitter.com/prideflagbot) account (gone but not forgotten!) run by @/michalpazur, which was a big inspiration.
